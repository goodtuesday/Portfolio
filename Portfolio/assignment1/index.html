<h3> About Me </h3>

<p> Eric Sievers is an attorney and (presently aspiring) web developer residing in Durham, North Carolina. He earned a Juris Doctor from Elon University in 2015 and completed his bachelor's degree in 2009 at Appalachian State University as a philosophy and psychology double major.  He loves playing blues on the piano and has made over 250 skydives.  He holds a PADI open water certification and can even juggle.  Eric is currently studying front and back-end web development through The Coding Boot Camp at UNC Chapel Hill.  He's a really swell guy too. 

This is a website that he made in order to demonstrate the crescive tightness of his CSS skills.  For example, right now this text is wrapping around the black and white photograph of Eric remaining dapper while taking a wrench to a 1984 Honda XL125.  His CSS skills aren't really that tight yet, but they will be soon.  And as they grow, so will this page.  So keep checking in to watch it develop.
